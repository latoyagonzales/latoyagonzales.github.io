## Grammar?

Too many times have I run into the issue of my code not working due to a simple syntax error. Just like in English class how we have grammar, in a way, I believe that coding standards are that for coding languages. They not only help to minimize errors within the code, but also help to standardize code for ease of readability. This ultimately creates a type of universal understanding for other readers as well.

## ESLint with IntelliJ

This semester, we have begun to use ESLint with IntelliJ IDEA. I have found this to be an extremely helpful tool. For the most part, it has not been too difficult to receive the green check mark. However, I believe that this is because I have started to get used to the causes of errors and am able to prevent them beforehand. I prefer it a lot because it not only highlights your errors, but also recommends the fixes for you. This is extremely beneficial in my opinion, in terms of both understanding and time efficiency.
