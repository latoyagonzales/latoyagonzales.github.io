## The Basics

Before my current Software Engineering course, I don't recall ever hearing the term "Design Pattern". Design Patterns are described to essentially be the blueprints for solving recurring problems.

While researching, I found that there are many different design patterns. However, they are categorized into three different groups which are:

1. Creational: Class instantiation
2. Structural: Class structure and composition
3. Behavioral: Class communication

## Javascript

Throughout this semester, we have worked in the Javascript language. An example of a design pattern (Creational) used in Javascript is:
- Prototype 
(Classes) 
"A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned".

## Meteor

Along with Javascript, I was introduced to the Meteor framework. An example of a design pattern (Behavioral) used in Meteor is:
- Observer 
(Publish-Subscribe, Reactive data)
"A way of notifying change to a number of classes".

## Project Applications

This semester, along with being assigned a final project of creating a specific  application, we were given examples as well. An example of a design pattern (Creational) used in the templates provided is :
- Singleton
(Collections)
"A class of which only a single instance can exist".

## Thoughts

Despite not being fully versed in the topic, or exactly how it all works, I am able to see the benefits of design patterns. They are proven to been extremely advantageous to software engineers. Along with reliability, they improve readability and I'm sure plenty of other things.
