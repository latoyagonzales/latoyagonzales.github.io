## So many options...

Iâ€™ve always been interested in Computer Science. However, once I decided to actually pursue a career in the field, I quickly noticed how broad of a field it actually was. 

## What about Software Engineering?

This semester, I am enrolled in a Software Engineering course at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Before this course, I had experience with the programming languages Python, Java, and C. However, I had absolutely no experience whatsoever with Javascript. So far, I am enjoying both the language and the course. 

## New Career Path?

Although it's way too early to commit to completely switching, I am interested. I am enjoying the couse so far and can't wait to learn as much as I can.
