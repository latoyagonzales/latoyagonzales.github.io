During my ALC course, in October of 2023, I coordinated and led a volunteer service project for myself and my peers. For this project, we went to clean the Veteran cemetery on base. We were tasked with picking up trash and just helping with overall beautification. 

The project helped me to further practice both my leadership and organization skills.
