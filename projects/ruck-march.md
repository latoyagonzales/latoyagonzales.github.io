The 640th REGT hosts a 26.2 Mile Ruck March Challenge for students during their time while in attendance in any course. Each Soldier who chooses to take part in the REGT ruck challenge requires a $55 fee, and a 35lb ruck sack or backpack. Soldiers who register must complete a total of 26.2 miles throughout their stay on Camp Williams. All 26.2 miles do not need to be completed in one iteration; Soldiers can break up the distance into multiple iterations. Each Soldier who takes part in this challenge will receive a finisherâ€™s medal at graduation, and a comment on their 1059 under the special projects or papers section.
